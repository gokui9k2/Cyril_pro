# MRI Breast Cancer Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains the work for a project focused on the collection, preprocessing, and analysis of medical imaging data for breast cancer detection.

The core of this project involves data processing and image processing, with a primary focus on preparing data for advanced computational analysis.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this repository are:
* **Data Collection:** Gathering and organizing medical data, specifically breast MRIs.
* **Preprocessing:** Implementing robust pipelines for cleaning, normalizing, and standardizing raw imaging data.
* **Image Registration:** Finding the optimal parameters for the registration algorithm to separate time series based on good or bad registration quality.

## The Role of DCE-MRI

A key focus of this work is DCE MRI.

DCE-MRI is an advanced MR technique that provides functional information, not just static anatomy. It involves capturing a rapid series of images dynamically over time, immediately following the injection of a (Gadolinium-based) contrast agent.

The analysis of how this contrast agent flows into and out of tissue (its "perfusion") is an emerging and powerful approach in breast cancer research. It provides critical functional data that helps differentiate suspicious lesions from healthy tissue, offering insights that are not available from standard, non-contrast MRI.
