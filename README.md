# Repository Description

This repository presents a collection of projects I have developed as part of my work in data science and machine learning.
It includes three main projects:

* A **computer vision model** based on Convolutional Neural Networks trained on fish mages.
* A **physics-inspired neural network**, exploring the integration of physical principles into deep learning, an area I believe holds great potential for future research and industrial applications.
* An MRI project on medical data exploring the quality of a new method for cancer detection.
