# Repository Description

This repository presents a collection of projects I have developed as part of my work in data science and machine learning.
It includes two main projects:

* A **computer vision model** based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on fish iamges
* A **physics-inspired neural network**, exploring the integration of physical principles into deep learning  an area I believe holds great potential for future research and applications for industry
