# Cyril Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! I am passionate about applying **Deep Learning** and **Data Science** to solve complex problems and to pursue my interests in this field.

This repository highlights a selection of my projects.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Marine Species Classification : Computer Vision

A computer vision model for the identification and tracking of marine species.

* **Goal:** Developing a robust deep learning model for the classification of tropical blue fish.
* **Skills:** `Computer Vision`, `Deep Learning`, `TensorFlow/Keras`, `Pytorch`, `OpenCV`

### 2. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN)

Exploring the integration of fundamental physical principles directly into neural network architectures.

* **Goal:** mplementation of the PINN model, performance testing on benchmark data.
* **Skills:** `PINNs`, `Deep Learning`, `PyTorch`,`Feature Engineering`

### 3. Medical Image Analysis for Cancer Detection

An exploratory analysis project focusing on 3D machine learning on volumetric data. This project is still ongoing, involving data collection and processing now, with plans to apply machine learning methods in the future.

* **Goal:** To explore 3D machine learning on medical data.
* **Skills:** `Medical Image Analysis`, `Pandas`
